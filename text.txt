This is a test file for the getnextline function.
It contains multiple lines with varying lengths.
The goal is to ensure that getnextline can correctly read each line until the end of the file.
Additionally, there are some empty lines and lines with only whitespace characters to handle edge cases.
The function should handle different newline characters (\n, \r\n) properly as well.
Let's add a longer line to test the function's ability to handle large buffers and dynamic memory allocation.
This should cover most scenarios, but feel free to add more specific cases if needed.
